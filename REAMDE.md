# FIREFOX EXTENSION TO HIDE AN ELEMENT

Sometimes we need to hide an element on the page in order to view a var_dump variable.

This extension helps us doing so by

1. Rightclick on an element
2. Select 'Hide Element' on the contextual menu

## INSTALLATION

1. Open Firefox and navigate to about:debugging.
2. Click "This Firefox" (or "Load Temporary Add-on" in older versions).
3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select your manifest.json file.
